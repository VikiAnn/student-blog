This week I completed my first pair project at Turing School. We worked on Event Reporter
(http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/event_reporter.html), a project that comprises
of a REPL where the user can issue various commands to load, search through, display, and
save data from CSV files. We did manage to complete it in time for the evaluation on Thursday
morning, despite a few roadblocks and communication failures along the way.

The first communication breakdown was on the day the project kicked off. In the project kick-off,
we were told that we could but didn't have to complete the Event Manager tutorial, which would walk us
through some of the basic data cleaning procedures we would need for the Event Reporter project. In
our initial pairing session immediately following the kick-off, we both felt we should complete the
tutorial prior to beginning the project, so we started that together right then. However, we quickly
realized that we would not be able to finish it as a pair due to mutually exclusive schedules on Friday
evening and Saturday. We decided to work individually on the tutorial and touch base afterwards to start
pairing on the project. What we failed to do at that point was to identify a specific method of getting
in touch - I assumed Slack would be fine and didn't bother to ask about exchanging phone numbers, and
I guess it didn't occur to my pair or me to figure that out ahead of time.

I had completed the tutorial by Sunday afternoon, so I sent my pair a message on Slack letting him know
I was available for the rest of the day if he wanted to get started. Unfortunately, he didn't end up
seeing my message at all until Monday morning, so we were unable to begin work on our project until Monday
afternoon, by which point it already felt like crunch time since the project was due Thursday morning.

With three days of work time available, we set to work, and resolved the communication and scheduling issue
by having my pair reconfigure his Slack settings so that he would get notifications for direct messages. We
were both about equally determined to get the project done, however much work or time it would take. We stayed
late over the next three evenings, hard at work. That was probably where we best matched up as a pair - we
were both willing to do whatever it took to get it working on time.

The next issue we ran into was in trying too quickly to re-use code from previous tutorials and projects
before we were totally familiar with what our project's structure should look like, and I think the code we
re-purposed sort of steered our project in a direction that wasn't totally ideal for what we were working on,
which confused our naming and class responsibilities a bit. We ended up searching and replacing irrelevant names
with more descriptive ones just before turning it in on Thursday morning.

The only other significant issue we ran into was mostly on my end - I realized towards the end that I was having
a really hard time letting go of any control of the project. That ended up working out OK for this project since
we basically spent the entire time working on it together, but it may not have been ideal if we had tried working
on separate pieces of the project individually. I also caught myself shooting down some of his ideas when we were
stuck trying to figure out how to make various pieces work. He was amiable enough not to give me a hard time for it,
but it's something I'd like to do better at next time.

Overall, though, the project turned out well, and we got better scores on our evaluation than either of us expected.
For next time, I've got three goals:
* Exchange preferred contact info first, preferably at least two methods of contact
* Explain any availability issues next, before the actual project work starts
* During the project work, strive for more of a balance of control over the project between both members of the team

Hopefully that works out!
